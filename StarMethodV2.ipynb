It was my task to learn my former co-workers duties quickly and complete their work and my own on time. I studied their job description and ticked off the work I could quickly complete. Now for the tasks I was unsure of, I read the company operating procedures and used online training tutorials. Now once confidence I prioritized all my tasks based on the company's needs. Red tasks were urgent and came first, Amber tasks second and green tasks could be completed when I had more time available. Now by using a systematic approach to learning and completing all tasks, I could do the work of two people which helped the company in its time of need.\""

To make sure we were prepared, I realized we needed a better schedule. For the next summer, I had a very strict shift schedule ready, and a reward system in case someone couldn’t show up for their shift. If someone called in sick, whoever filled in for them would be rewarded with extra pay. And if there was absolutely no one else available, I would personally fill in for them instead. Overall, the summer went pretty smoothly with minimal accidents. We didn’t get ANY negative reviews on TripAdvisor for the summer (whereas for the summer before that, we had several for slow service).\"\n",

My task was to research different code generators and select the best option to suit our needs. After extensive screening, I identified a coding generator which was used by similar companies within our industry. The switchover took place smoothly and we experienced no disruption to our workflow. As an unexpected benefit, we were able to streamline our coding process, reducing the time spent writing code significantly. -> Solution A: Provide details about the situation, the actions taken, and the outcome.
